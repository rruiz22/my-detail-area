## üìã Migration Instructions

### To Apply the Database Changes:

1. **Run the migrations in Supabase Dashboard** (SQL Editor):
   ```sql
   -- First, run the invoices system:
   -- Copy contents from: supabase/migrations/20241016_create_invoices_system.sql

   -- Then, run the analytics functions:
   -- Copy contents from: supabase/migrations/20241016_create_reports_functions.sql
   ```

2. **Verify the tables were created**:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   AND table_name IN ('invoices', 'invoice_items', 'payments', 'scheduled_reports');
   ```

3. **Test the functions**:
   ```sql
   -- Test with your dealer ID
   SELECT * FROM get_orders_analytics(
     1, -- dealer_id
     NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days',
     NOW(),
     'all',
     'all'
   );
   ```
