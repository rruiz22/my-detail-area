## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Live Region Not Announcing
**Symptom:** Status messages not heard by screen reader

**Solution:**
✅ Already Implemented:
- `role="status"` on live region
- `aria-live="polite"` for non-intrusive announcements
- `aria-atomic="true"` to read entire message
- `sr-only` class to hide visually but expose to screen readers

**Code:**
```tsx
<div
  role="status"
  aria-live="polite"
  aria-atomic="true"
  className="sr-only"
>
  {liveRegionMessage}
</div>
```

---

### Issue 2: Button Purpose Unclear
**Symptom:** Icon-only buttons not descriptive

**Solution:**
✅ Already Implemented:
- `aria-label` on all icon buttons
- Descriptive labels: "Refresh service orders", "Create new service order"

**Code:**
```tsx
<Button
  aria-label={t('accessibility.service_orders.refresh_button', 'Refresh service orders')}
>
  <RefreshCw className="h-4 w-4" />
</Button>
```

---

### Issue 3: Modal Focus Management
**Symptom:** Focus not trapped in modal

**Solution:**
⚠️ Verify Implementation:
- Check if modal component traps focus
- Ensure Tab/Shift+Tab cycle within modal
- Verify Escape key closes modal

**Recommendation:**
- If using shadcn/ui Dialog, focus trap should be built-in
- Test with keyboard navigation
- Verify with screen reader

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. Live Region Guidelines
✅ **Use `aria-live="polite"`** - Non-intrusive announcements
✅ **Use `role="status"`** - Semantic meaning for status updates
✅ **Use `aria-atomic="true"`** - Read entire message, not just changes
✅ **Use `sr-only`** - Visually hidden but screen reader accessible

### 2. ARIA Label Guidelines
✅ **Descriptive labels** - "Refresh service orders" not just "Refresh"
✅ **Context-specific** - Labels include "service orders" context
✅ **Translations** - All labels translated to 3 languages
✅ **Supplement, not replace** - aria-labels supplement visible text

### 3. Semantic HTML Guidelines
✅ **Use `<main>`** - Clear main content landmark
✅ **Use `<button>`** - Proper button elements, not div with click handlers
✅ **Use headings** - Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
✅ **Use lists** - Semantic list markup where appropriate

### 4. Keyboard Navigation Guidelines
✅ **Tab order** - Logical, follows visual layout
✅ **Focus visible** - Clear focus indicators
✅ **Escape key** - Closes modals and cancels operations
✅ **Enter/Space** - Activates buttons and links
