## Security Pattern

### Role Hierarchy
```
system_admin         - Full access to all data across all dealerships
    ‚Üì
dealer_admin         - Full access to own dealership data
    ‚Üì
dealer_manager       - Limited management access to own dealership
    ‚Üì
dealer_user          - Read access, limited write based on permissions
```

### Permission Levels
- **Dealership Isolation**: Users only see data from their dealership
- **Module Permissions**: Granular access per feature (sales_orders, contacts, etc.)
- **Operation Permissions**: Separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- **Admin Overrides**: System admins bypass all restrictions

### Helper Functions
```sql
get_user_dealership()                        -- Returns current user's dealership ID
is_system_admin()                            -- Returns true if system admin
can_access_dealership(dealership_id)         -- Check dealership access
user_has_dealer_membership(user_id, dealer_id) -- Check membership
user_has_group_permission(user_id, dealer_id, permission) -- Check permission
```

---

## Application Instructions

### Step 1: Backup Database (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard
# Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Create Backup
# Name: "pre-rls-fix-2025-10-25"
```

### Step 2: Apply Main Migration
```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Copy contents of 20251025_fix_critical_rls_security.sql
# 3. Execute (takes ~30-60 seconds)
# 4. Verify success message appears

# Option B: Via Supabase CLI (if installed)
cd C:\Users\rudyr\apps\mydetailarea
supabase db push
```

**Expected Output**:
```
============================================================================
CRITICAL RLS SECURITY FIX MIGRATION COMPLETE
============================================================================
Tables with RLS enabled: 80+
Tables without RLS: 0
Tables with policies: 70+
Tables with RLS but no policies: 0

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Created 5 helper functions for RLS checks
2. Enabled RLS on 13 public tables
3. Created policies for 6 v2 tables (dealership-scoped)
4. Created policies for 7 backup tables (admin-only)
5. Created policies for 18 tables with RLS but no policies
6. Created performance indexes for common queries
============================================================================
```

### Step 3: Run Verification Script
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
# 1. Copy contents of 20251025_verify_rls_coverage.sql
# 2. Execute
# 3. Review comprehensive security report
```

**Expected Security Score**: 95-100/100 (Grade A+)

### Step 4: Test with Different Roles

#### Test as System Admin
```sql
-- Login as: rruiz@lima.llc (system_admin)
-- Should see ALL data from ALL dealerships

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dealerships_v2;  -- Should see all dealerships
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;          -- Should see all orders
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;        -- Should see all users
```

#### Test as Dealer Admin
```sql
-- Login as a dealer admin user
-- Should see ONLY their dealership data

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dealerships_v2;  -- Should see 1 (own dealership)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE dealer_id = get_user_dealership();
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE dealership_id = get_user_dealership();
```

#### Test as Dealer User
```sql
-- Login as a regular dealer user
-- Should have limited access based on permissions

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE dealer_id = get_user_dealership();
-- Should see orders from own dealership

-- Try to insert (should succeed if has permission)
INSERT INTO dealership_contacts (...) VALUES (...);

-- Try to delete (should fail if no delete permission)
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 'some-id';
-- Error: permission denied for table orders
```

---

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, rollback immediately:

### Quick Rollback (Restore Backup)
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard
# Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups
# Select "pre-rls-fix-2025-10-25"
# Click "Restore"
```

### Manual Rollback (If Needed)
```sql
-- 1. Drop helper functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_user_dealership();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS is_system_admin();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS can_access_dealership(BIGINT);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS user_has_dealer_membership(UUID, BIGINT);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS user_has_group_permission(UUID, BIGINT, TEXT);

-- 2. Disable RLS on affected tables (ONLY IF NECESSARY)
ALTER TABLE dealerships_v2 DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE roles_v2 DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- Repeat for all 13 tables if needed

-- 3. Policies will be automatically dropped when functions are dropped
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Only rollback if critical issues occur. This will re-expose security vulnerabilities.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "permission denied for table X"
**Cause**: User doesn't have required permissions
**Solution**:
1. Check user's role in profiles table
2. Verify user's group memberships
3. Check dealer_groups permissions
4. Grant necessary permissions or adjust RLS policy

### Issue: "No data showing in application"
**Cause**: RLS policy too restrictive or user not in dealership
**Solution**:
1. Verify user has dealership_id set in profiles
2. Check dealer_memberships table
3. Test query with EXPLAIN to see policy evaluation
4. Temporarily test as system_admin to isolate issue

### Issue: "Slow query performance"
**Cause**: RLS policies add complexity to queries
**Solution**:
1. Check if indexes are being used (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
2. Add missing indexes for common query patterns
3. Consider materialized views for complex queries
4. Optimize policy conditions

### Issue: "Function not found error"
**Cause**: Helper functions not created
**Solution**:
1. Re-run migration Part 1 (helper functions)
2. Grant EXECUTE permissions
3. Clear function cache: `SELECT pg_reload_conf();`
